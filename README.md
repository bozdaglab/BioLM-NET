# **BioLM-NET**  
## BioLM-NET: An interpretable deep-learning model combining prior biological knowledge and contextual LLM gene embeddings on multi-omics data to predict disease.


## Overview
Biologically informed deep neural networks which connect input features to hidden layers based on known gene–pathway relationships have become increasingly popular. However, existing approaches often omit key molecular interactions such as Protein–Protein Interactions (PPI) and Protein–DNA Interactions (PDI).

Contribution of **BioLM-NET** :
- Fusing single-cell or bulk gene expression data with DNA methylation profiles
- Integrating PPI and PDI networks directly into the model architecture
- Aggregating omics signals at the pathway level via an attention-based pathway layer
- Incorporating contextual gene embeddings generated by a pre-trained large language model (LLM)

1. **Omics branches**  
   - **Gene expression** and **DNA methylation** processed through separate masked-dense layers informed by PPI/PDI  
2. **Pathway Attention Layer**  
   - Projects gene and methylation branch embeddings to pathway representations  
   - Applies attention weights guided by LLM-derived gene embeddings  
3. **Fusion & Prediction**  
   - Concatenates pathway-level representations  
   - Passes through dense fusion layers to output disease-state probabilities
